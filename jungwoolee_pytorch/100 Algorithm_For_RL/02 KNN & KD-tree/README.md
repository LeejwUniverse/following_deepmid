# KNN & KD-tree

---

# Todo list
- [X] Implementation basic KNN (calculate all data point using euclidean distance)
- [X] Implementation KNN with KD-tree (using median)

1. K-NN with Kd-tree
- [ ] Complete Search function.(K-NN with KD Tree)
- [ ] Implementation a pruning policy. (Approximate K-NN with KD Tree)
- [ ] Write README.md for explaining algorithm.
